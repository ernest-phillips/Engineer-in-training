## About

An individual development plan, or **IDP**, is a document completed by individual Hubbers for the plan of self-development over the next period, usually 6-12 months. This plan is then reviewed and discussed with the manager to match the individual goals with GitHub's goals and opportunities. Keep in mind, this is "Individual", so make it yours - feel free to add additional questions and/or skip any that you may find not applicable.

### Key Development Areas

**:exclamation: Discuss the following questions with your manager**

Narrow the focus of your development on 2-3 key areas. Although creating IDP's are encouraged yearround, April and October may be good months to reevaluate and set new goals for the upcoming [Reflection cycles](https://thehub.github.com/hr/total-rewards/reflection-and-rewards-cycle/), which you can discuss during 1:1's with your manager.

```Skills``` _**What are the 2-3 development areas you want to work on in the next 6 months?**_ _e.g. Leadership._ _Be specific and provide some context about each one so you can help define and identify targeted solutions to address these._ <br>
**Response**:

```Success:``` _**What would success look like if you focus on the skills you identified above?**_ _i.e. *‚ÄúLeadership‚Äù* doesn‚Äôt mean much if you‚Äôre not clear on what it means to you and can express it to others._ <br>
