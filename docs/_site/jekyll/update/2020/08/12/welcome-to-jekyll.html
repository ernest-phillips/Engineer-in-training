I’m Ernest, and I am using this site to learn in public.
I currently work at GitHub as a Support Engineer, where I get to help
other developers do awesome work on the platform.
I get to read and write code at work, but I want to be better at it!
I will use this blog to document what I am learning in order to share my knowledge,
and become a better developer through that process. 
As the title of the site goes, I’m just trying to get good! Not only at software development, but
other areas of interest, such as art and math!
I hope you find this info useful. I will make mistakes along the way, but that’s all
a part of the process.</p>

<p>Looking forward to sharing my journey with you!</p>
