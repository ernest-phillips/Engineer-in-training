  <br />
Iâ€™m Ernest, and I am using this site to learn in public.
I currently work at GitHub as a Support Engineer, where I get to help
other developers do awesome work on the platform.
I get to read and write code at work, but I want to be better at it!
I will use this blog to document what I am learning in order to share my knowledge,
and become a better developer through that process. 
As the title of the site goes, Iâ€™m just trying to get good! Not only at software development, but
other areas of interest, such as art and math!
I hope you find this info useful. I will make mistakes along the way, but thatâ€™s all
a part of the process.</p>
